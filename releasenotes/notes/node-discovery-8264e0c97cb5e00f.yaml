    Allow enabling auto-discovery of ironic nodes by setting new option
    ``enable_node_discovery=True`` in the ``undercloud.conf``. When enabled,
    adds unknown nodes that boot the introspection ramdisk to ironic in the
    ``enroll`` provisioning state and the driver set to the value of
    ``discovery_default_driver`` configuration option (``pxe_ipmitool`` by
    default). See ironic-inspector documentation for more details:
    https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest/user/usage.html#discovery.
